I’m an incoming Ph.D. student at Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), under the supervision of [Prof. Dongdong She](https://cse.hkust.edu.hk/~dongdong/) and [Prof. Shuai Wang](https://www.cse.ust.hk/~shuaiw/). I have broad research interests, including systems security, software engineering, and related topics in AI and web3.

Prior to joining [HKUST](https://hkust.edu.hk/), I obtained my bachelor and master’s degree from [SJTU](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/).

I can be reached at <span id="_eml" class="gl-eml">someone at example dot com</span>.

## Publications

```blog-bib

@comment
{
Use #bibitem_Venue_Key to refer to "Venue:Key".

It is possible to have multiple BibTeX blocks, which will be rendered independently. For example, you might want to have one block for each of "Publications", "Pre-prints", and "Manuscripts".

To support more information links (e.g., add "slides" or "pdf" links),
see "builder/marked.0.3.6/bibtex-service.js" line 109.
